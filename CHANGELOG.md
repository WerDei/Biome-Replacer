- Fixed compatibility issue with some TerraBlender-based mods (vanilla biomes weren't always replaced)
- As a side effect, we now have full TerraBlender support. It's now possible to replace or remove modded biomes added with it.
  - (You should still use mod configs whenever possible, but is now an option of you really want it)
- Fixed missing logo on Forge
