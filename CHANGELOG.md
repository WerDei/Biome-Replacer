# Biome replacer 2.0 - the Omniversion Update

- Now supports both Fabric and Neoforge/Forge, across every* version since 1.18.2!
From now on, new mod releases will be available for all of them at the same time.
- New logo and banner, made by LegendarySpy
- Experimental feature: remove biomes with a random chance.
- Fabric: Removed Fabric API dependency (it wasn't used anyway)

\* Some in-between versions have been skipped for our convenience. But if you play on one of those and need this mod, 
don't hesitate to reach out to us on [GitGub](https://github.com/WerDei/Biome-Replacer/issues), and we'll see what we can do!
