- Added biome tag support
- In config file, comments now start with `!` instead of `#`.

  **Note:** If you used comments (`#`) in your config file, you might see errors in game logs. You might need to manually change every `#` to `!` to fix it.
- New icon by LegendarySpy

**Known issue:** in singleplayer, rules will not load when loading an existing world. 
As a workaround, you might need to load into a world twice.
